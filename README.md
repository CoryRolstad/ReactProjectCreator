# React Project Creator
This project allows you to utilize docker to both create a new project and utilize docker for a development enviornment for React.

The first time you run the powershell script it grabs the base image and installs the React dependencies, then leverages react-creat-app application to create a base react application. *Note* You do have to mount that directory within docker desktop for it to work properly.  The powershell script will create the dockerfile, docker-compose, and will create a folder with the application name you specified within the directory you specified.  Once the PS script is finished, just run docker-compose up' and it will start the development server and mount the development directory to your container.
